| Tricks of the Trade | 0% | 0% | 100% | Restores CP by 20. Can only be used when material condition is Good | 0 |
| Waste Not | 0% | 0% | 100% | Cuts durability loss in half for the next 4 steps | 56 |
| Waste Not II | 0% | 0% | 100% | Cuts durability loss in half for the next 8 steps | 98 |
| Master's Mend | 0% | 0% | 100% | Restores durability by 30 (cannot overcap) | 88 |
| Manipulation | 0% | 0% | 100% | Restores 5 durability after each step for the next 8 steps | 96 |

Notes:
- Did not include Trained Eye. It is not possible to use on expert crafts, as they are level 80.
- Anything that affects "touch" actions also affects Byregot's Blessing and the quality increase on Delicate Synthesis.
- Anything that can be used on a Good can also be used on an Excellent, but Excellent and Poor procs do not exist in expert crafts.
- Base durability cost is 10.
