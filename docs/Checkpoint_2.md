## Updated Schedule

Since the last checkpoint we have worked on improving our genetic algorithms core functions to provide more genetic diversity in each simulation run. We have also added multi-threading support to make each generations processing time as quick as possible.

We also have improved the game simulation using community resources and are close to finishing the implementation for the Genetic algorithm.

The current plan is to finish the simulation this week and start processing the results starting next week, leading into the final report.
