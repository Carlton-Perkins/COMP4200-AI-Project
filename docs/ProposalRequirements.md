# Proposal Requirements

## Requirements

- Title
  - <10 Words
  - Developing Strategies for Expert Crafting in Final Fantasy XIV?
- Problem Statement
  - What needs to be solved?
    - Identify successful strategies for expert crafting at a competitive level
  - 3+ Papers backing why / connecting to project
- Problem Analysis
  - AI Type/Approach
    - And/Or tree maybe? But this may lead to the AI "cheating" by choosing states where actions succeed/material conditions are favorable, which are things outside of its control
  - State Space
    - Enumerate if possible
    - _Draft State Space:_
      - Material Status (can do enum integer representation or string)
      - Current CP (unsigned short)
      - Current Durability (unsigned short)
      - Current Progress (unsigned short)
      - Current Quality (unsigned int)
      - Buffs:
        - \# Inner Quiet Stacks (unsigned short)
        - Waste Not/Waste Not II turns left (can be one buff) (unsigned short)
        - Manipulation turns left (unsigned short)
        - Innovation turns left (unsigned short)
        - Veneration turns left (unsigned short)
        - Name of the Elements turns left (unsigned short)
        - Final Appraisal turns left (unsigned short)
        - Great Strides turns left (unsigned short)
        - Muscle Memory turns left (unsigned short)
        - Observe used last turn (bool)
  - State Transition Function
    - How does State get changed?
      - Each action affects different state attributes; can probably implement classes to streamline this
    - Are transitions Deterministic/Stochastic
      - Stochastic: some actions can fail, condition is chosen at random
  - Evaluation function
    - What is the goal?
      - Full progress, quality >= 58000
    - How do we define better states from worse states?
      - Higher quality
      - Shallower solution depth
  - Problem Characteristics
    - Fully observable or partially observable?
      - Fully: AI knows everything that will affect the outcome of its actions and what the outcome of each action will be (assuming success)
    - Single/multi agent
      - Single
    - Deterministic/stochastic
      - Stochastic: random material qualities, chance to fail some actions
    - Episodic/sequential
      - Sequential: previous actions affect future actions
    - static/dynamic
      - Static: no change between percepts
    - discrete/continuous
      - Discrete: all values are represented as integers
- Dataset
  - What data do we have access to?
  - How can this data be used to attack the problem
- Deliverable
  - What will the final product look like?
  - Will the simulator have a GUI?
    - In a perfect world, yes; action icons/names with colored borders corresponding to procs, maybe?
    - Perhaps include fields for user to input stats, if we have time
  - How will the AI 'play' the Game?
    - Complete individual crafts and accumulate steps/score as an overall evaluation
- Evaluation of correctness
  - How do we measure if the project is a success?
    - Compare to high scores on official leaderboard
- Schedule
  - Define 3 major components
  - Define deadlines
  - Absolute deadline is Dec 8
